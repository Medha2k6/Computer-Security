# CS361 Computer Security Academic Projects

Welcome to the repository for the CS361 Computer Security course, taught by Dr. Rakesh Matam. This repository contains academic projects that explore various aspects of computer security.

## Task 1: Malicious Software Analysis

- **Overview:**  
  This project explores the development and behavior of a simulated malicious software, named `v.cpp`, within a Linux environment. It focuses on how malware can modify files and propagate itself.

- **Objectives:**  
  1. Understand the construction and functionality of malicious software.
  2. Analyze the security implications of the simulated virus and worm.
  3. Enhance C++ programming skills through the implementation of malware-like behavior.
  4. Gain insights into threats to file integrity and confidentiality.

- **Implementation:**  
  The project involves creating a C++ program that searches for `.foo` files, appends its contents, and enables self-propagation via USB drives. It includes file I/O operations and system commands for directory scanning.

- **Key Findings:**  
  The project highlighted significant security risks, including threats to file integrity, unauthorized replication, and the potential for exploitation by malicious actors. It emphasized the importance of cybersecurity awareness.

## Task 2: Network Intrusion Detection System - Snort

- **Overview:**  
  This task involves setting up and using Snort, an open-source network intrusion detection system, to monitor and analyze network traffic for suspicious activities.

- **Objectives:**  
  1. Learn to sniff and analyze network packets for security threats.
  2. Implement Snort in different operational modes.
  3. Configure Snort on a Linux system and verify its operation.
  4. Gain practical experience in network intrusion detection.

- **Implementation:**  
  The task includes installing Wireshark and Snort, configuring Snort for specific network interfaces, and writing rules for packet analysis to monitor network traffic in real-time.

- **Key Findings:**  
  The assignment demonstrated Snort's effectiveness in identifying network anomalies and underscored the importance of intrusion detection systems in safeguarding networks against evolving cyber threats.
